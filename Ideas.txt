<<----------IDEAS---------->>
<<------------------------->>

>> Multiplayer game taking place within an office.

>> The goal is to create a better program than your
   competitors (the other players). You'e going to 
   have to play dirty to do this.

>> You start off by your desk in an office. 

>> You have to keep your "Caffeination" bar 
   from hitting 0 or you will fall asleep 
   and lose a few hours of game time. 

>> You also have to keep your motivation bar
   up by sitting on the sofas etc.

>> Finally, you need to be doing work at your
   computer to make progress on your program.

>> The coffee machines and sofas should be far
   away from the PCs - this means that other
   players will be able to either sabotage your
   work (causing you to lose progress), or they
   can steal your work (causing them to gain progress).

>> Periodically your manager will walk in, and if you
   aren't working at your desk, he will spend an hour
   or so disciplining you, causing you to lose time.

>> At the end of each <week??> you'll either get
   praised for creating a great program (maybe have
   the top x people getting this??), and the player
   that makes the worst program will be fired (and
   kicked from the game).

>> You can attempt to incapacitate other players, 
   and put them into a closet or something.
