<<----------IDEAS---------->>
<<------------------------->>

>> Multiplayer game taking place within an office.

>> The goal is to create a better program than your
   competitors (the other players). You'e going to 
   have to play dirty to do this.

>> You start off by your desk in an office. 

>> You have to keep your "Caffeination" bar 
   from hitting 0 or you will fall asleep 
   and lose a few hours of game time. 

>> You also have to keep your motivation bar
   up by sitting on the sofas etc.

>> Finally, you need to be doing work at your
   computer to make progress on your program.

>> The coffee machines and sofas should be far
   away from the PCs - this means that other
   players will be able to either sabotage your
   work (causing you to lose progress), or they
   can steal your work (causing them to gain progress).

>> Periodically your manager will walk in, and if you
   aren't at your desk, he will spend an hour or so
    disciplining you, causing you to lose time.
    (Or if you're asleep at your desk you'll get fired).

>> At the end of each <week??> you'll either get
   praised for creating a great program (maybe have
   the top x people getting this??), and the player
   that makes the worst program will be fired (and
   kicked from the game).

>> You can attempt to incapacitate other players, 
   and put them into a closet or something.

>> Before you join a game you should have to define
   a username, and this will be displayed as a 
   label by your PC (helps you to find where you're
   meant to be).

>> You should be able to sabotage the coffee machine and
   sofas to hinder other players too.

>> Nerf guns to fire at players to make them lose 
   motivation, and interrupt their working?

<<-----MUSIC----->>

>> mainTheme.ogg will play for the majority of the game.
>> caffeineMusic.ogg will play after the player has 
   drank a cup of coffee (or two).
>> sleepMusic.ogg will play either when the player
   becomes completely decaffeinated, or when the
   player is being disciplined by the manager.
